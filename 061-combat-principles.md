# Combat Principles

When asked if bot can favorable combat to achieve some result, first identify the goal, then refer to the corresponding section below. Goal will always be one of:

- Trophies for warlord
- Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to contend an ambition
- Control of a system

Bot will spend Weapon resources to enable combat and will spend Fuel and Psionic resources to maximize available actions during a combat.

A combat which risks outrages is only favorable if bot could ransack the court AND if outrage would not cause bot to stop contending a declared ambition. If bot is able to re-roll, first re-roll any intercepts, then re-roll blanks.

## Trophies

A Battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships<#ifdef campaign> or can roll 2 dice vs Blight<#endif>.

If bot has multiple actions, first roll all skirmish dice until ratio of fresh ships is better than 1:1, or only 1 action left. Then roll assault dice up to 2x defending fresh ships, and the rest skirmish dice. Allocate hits prioritizing trophies.

## Raid

A raid is considered favorable if bot can roll raid dice equal to 2x keys on the target AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one Battle action available after moving to the target.

If favorable, the bot will first spend actions to roll dice like a trophies Battle, up to the last action available, when it will roll raid dice.

## Control

A Battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per fresh defending ship. If favorable, bot will select dice like a trophies Battle. Bot will allocate hits to take control, then allocate hits to take trophies.
