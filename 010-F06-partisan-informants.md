If the player is the Partisan:

- Choose any bot to target.
- Draw action cards equal to the bot's hand counter from the stack.
- Place your action card of highest number on the bot's board.
- Take the action card of highest number from the bot. *(from among those drawn and any action cards on the bot's board, including the one you just placed)*
- Shuffle the remaining drawn action cards back into the stack.

If the bot is the Partisan:

- Bot will always target the player.
- Draw a number of action cards equal to the bot's hand counter from the stack.
- Take the action card of **lowest** number from the bot. *(from among those drawn and any action cards on the bot's board)*
- Place your action card of **highest** number on the bot's board.
- Shuffle the remaining drawn action cards back into the stack.

*At the end of these procedures, the bot will have one additional card on the bot's board, the bot's hand counter will not have changed, and the player's hand count will not have changed.*
