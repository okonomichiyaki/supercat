bot will select to declare ambition BEFORE checking bot's fate logic
may overly prioritize generic power over advancing objectives

generalize priority for triggering edicts
(generalize imperial ship construction -> edicts)

Flagship upgrades priorities

retain Imperial control?
any reason to do this?

difficulty mod: replenish fleet during intermission
bot with least power?
