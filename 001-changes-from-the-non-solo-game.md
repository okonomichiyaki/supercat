## Differences from the non-solo game

This is an exhaustive list of every way in which playing with SUPERCAT differs from the original Arcs rules, including optional difficulty modifiers and campaign specific rules. If you believe the bot breaks from the original Arcs rules in any way which is not listed here, that is either a misunderstanding, something accidentally omitted from this page, or a bug. Please report it in the BGG thread for correction or clarification!
