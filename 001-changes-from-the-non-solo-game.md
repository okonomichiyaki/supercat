## Differences to the non-solo game

This aims to be an exhaustive list of every deviation from how original, non-solo Arcs plays. This includes optional difficulty modifiers and campaign specific rules, and is ordered roughly from most significant to least significant.

- trick-taking card play: abstract hands for bots
- Partisan "Informants"
- difficulty modifiers
- (campaign) the solo player will have less information about what Faithful cards will be played during a round: they don't know exactly which Rival has Faithful cards, which differs compared to the multiplayer game
- (campaign) negotiation minigame
- (campaign) Pathfinder portal deduction minigame
