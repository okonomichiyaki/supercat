## Differences from the non-solo game

This is a list of every way in which playing with SUPERCAT differs from playing multiplayer Arcs with the the original rules, including optional difficulty modifiers and campaign specific rules. If you think the bot breaks from the original Arcs rules in any way which is not listed here, that is either something accidentally omitted from this page, an unintended "bug" in the bot rules, or a misunderstanding. Please report it in the [BGG thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3499164/updating-supercat-for-solo-blighted-reach) for correction or clarification.
