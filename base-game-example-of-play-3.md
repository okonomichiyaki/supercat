it's yellow bot's turn, and after getting beat up by red, these are the cards it draws:

[example 19]

we get to this section of the first page ("Bot turn") again:

[q][i]✦ Can bot surpass with any card?[/i][/q]

Yellow bot can't Surpass so it must Copy or Pivot. but first we check to see if it will seize:

[q][i]
- If seize counter is on bot's board, increment it, else place seize counter, with a value of 1.
- If hand counter is 2 or greater and initiative was not already seized this round, check for seize:
	- Roll 1d6, and subtract 1 for each undeclared ambition that bot is winning. Seize initiative if result is less than seize counter. Decrement hand counter to represent bot discarding an extra card.
[/i][/q]

so we place a counter on the board showing 1 (this is the yellow counter in the picture above). yellow bot's hand counter is 3, so it could seize by discarding an extra card and still have 2 cards in the round. however, the bot will only seize if the random check passes. right now yellow bot is not winning any undeclared ambitions, so it's not possible for the roll to pass. so we continue to the General Priorities page again, and arrive here:

[q][i]
✦ Does bot have unbuilt cities?
- Does bot have fewer claims than unbuilt cities?
- Yes: Can bot move to get a new claim? → Mobilization/Aggression
- No: Does bot have at least one claim? → Construction
[/i][/q]

this time, the bot pivots to Construction and builds 2 cities. (note that even though it's pivoting, it will still get an extra action for the difficulty modifier) the Construction page first checks to see if the bot has a starport, which yellow does, and then instructs us to build cities, preferring systems where the bot has control: 

[q][i]
✦ Does bot have no starport?
✦ Are any loyal buildings controlled by a rival?
...
✦ Can bot Build cities? Prefer:
- system with control
[/i][/q]

yellow bot builds cities at the Weapon planet 3-Crescent and at the Material planet 6-Arrow:

[example 20]

blue Surpasses with the 3 of Aggression (remember red bot declared with the 5 of Aggression and placed the 0 marker) and conducts a couple of battles vs red bot, getting a bit lucky with assault dice and taking 2 red ships as trophies. here's the board at the end of round 3:

[example 21]

blue takes the initiative, then leads with the 2 of Mobilization, using a Material in their Prelude to build another city in the Relic planet 2-Hex, then influencing Lattice Spies and Material Cartel each twice. (i'm glossing over blue's turns quickly as these are not that important to understanding the bot although their board state obviously has implications for the bot actions)

next it's red bot's turn and these are the cards drawn: 5 of Construction and 6 of Administration. red does not have initiative, and cannot Surpass. so like yellow bot's turn, we place a seize counter on red's board. here, the seize check is significant, because red bot is winning Warlord so if it rolled a 1 it would pass and seize initiative (since 1 minus 1 is 0 which is less than 1) but in this case red bot rolls a 5 and so we go to General Priorities again. following the list of priorities in General Priorities leads the bot to play Construction, and build cities. i won't cover this in detail as i've already gone over those procedures.

the 2 cards drawn for red bot's turn were the last 2 cards in the stack. for yellow bot's turn, [b]we will shuffle the discard pile before drawing 2 cards[/b]. this is a bit unusual for Arcs since you never shuffle the action deck mid round, but it's the only way to make the "draw 2, play 1" system work with 3 players. this obviously completely screws with the solo player's ability to count cards, which i don't consider to be problem (partly because i personally struggle to count cards in Arcs so usually don't try, and partly because the extra chaos seems appropriate for the solo experience) i wanted to make sure it was clear that this is how the system works.

after shuffling, yellow bot draws a 5 and 3 of Aggression. the bot can't surpass with Aggression so we end up incrementing the seize counter and rolling to check if the bot will seize. this time the bot rolls a 1 which is less than the 2 shown, so we decrement the hand counter to represent the bot discarding an extra card and take the initiative marker.

we still go to General Priorities to determine what card to play (although the bot drew two Aggression cards, it could still choose to Copy the lead Mobilization card so the General Priorities will decide between those options) Reading down the list of priorities leads to this:

[q][i]
✦ Can bot Tax or Secure to contend undeclared ambition, take captives, or grow a lead in a declared ambition? → Administration/Aggression
[/i][/q]

yellow bot can secure Admin Union which would contend Tycoon, so it will Pivot with Aggression rather than Copy Mobilization
yellow bot still won't spend the Psionic while Empath is declared, so turning to the page for Aggression, after Securing Admin Union, we get to this procedure:

[q][i]
✦ Are there any ambition markers available?
- Can bot favorable combat to take trophies?
[/i][/q]

there's still 1 ambition marker available, and yellow bot has a few options where it can favorable combat for trophies. the Combat Principles state

[q][i]
A Battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships
[/i][/q]

Yellow bot only has 1 action remaining, so we are looking for systems where the bot can battle in place. There are 3 systems where it has 1:1 ratio of fresh ships, and Combat Principles picks between them with this preference:

[q][i]
Prefer target where most possible trophies.
[/i][/q]

[example 24]

so yellow bot will battle the blue player in Gate 3.
with only one action, yellow bot will select 2 assault dice according to Combat Principles. here's the result:

[example 25]

and here's the board state at the end of the round:

[example 26]

after seizing the initiative, yellow bot leads the next round. we draw 2 cards and remove the hand counter from the bot's board representing 0 remaining cards in hand. we also remove the seize counter. yellow bot draws a 3 of Administration and a 5 of Mobilization, and is not winning or tied for either ambition, so we refer to General Priorities. skipping past procedures which don't apply, we get to this now familiar question:

[q][i]
✦ Does bot have unbuilt cities?
- Does bot have fewer claims than unbuilt cities?
[/i][/q]

the answer to the first question is "yes", but the answer to the nested question is "no".
yellow bot has two unbuilt cities (note that the city which red bot took as a trophy is not an "unbuilt city") but also has three claims. Construction is not an option among the suits drawn, so we have to keep reading and arrive here again:

[q][i]
✦ Can bot Tax or Secure to contend undeclared ambition, take captives, or grow a lead in a declared ambition? → Administration/Aggression
[/i][/q]

yellow bot could Tax to gain Material which would result in winning Tycoon, so it will select the Administration card. as always, we check for Prelude actions, and this time there is a new option: the Admin Union. the Prelude page says:

[q][i]
Bot will discard all Union cards to gain bonus action cards. Place action card in bot's play area, and increment bot's hand counter.
[/i][/q]

(This will happen at the end of the round, of course)
