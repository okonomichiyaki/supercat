# Combat Doctrine

When evaluating a bot turn you may be asked if the bot can <ins>favorable combat</ins> to achieve some result. First, identify the goal, then refer to the corresponding section. Goal will always be one of:

- Trophies for warlord
- Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to contend an ambition
- Control of a system

## Trophies

A battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships.

If bot has multiple actions to spend, first spend actions to roll skirmish dice until ratio of fresh ships is better than 1:1, or only 1 action left. Then roll all assault dice if ratio is better than 1:1, or select half skirmish dice and half assault dice (round in favor of skirmish dice).

## Raid

A raid is considered favorable if bot can roll raid dice equal to 2x the number of keys on the target AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one battle action available after moving to the target.

If favorable, the bot will first spend actions to roll dice like a trophies battle, up to the last action available, when it will roll raid dice.

## Control

A battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per fresh defending ship.

## Outrage

Prior to spending an action for battle, check for risk of outrage.

- If outrage would cause bot to stop <ins>contending</ins> a declared ambition, then the battle is not considered favorable.
- Otherwise, battle which risks outrage is only considered favorable if bot could ransack the court after trigging outrage.
