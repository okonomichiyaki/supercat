# Combat Doctrine

When evaluating a bot turn you may be asked if the bot can conduct a "favorable battle" to achieve some result. Use the following guidelines to determine if the bot will conduct the action.

First, identify the goal. This will always be one of the following:
- Trophies for warlord
- Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to contend an ambition
- Control of a system

Once identified, follow the procedure corresponding to the goal below.

## Trophies

A battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships.

When selecting dice, if bot has multiple actions to spend, first spend actions to roll skirmish dice until ratio of fresh ships is better than 1:1, or only 1 action left. Then roll all assault dice if ratio is better than 1:1, or select half skirmish dice and half assault dice (round in favor of skirmish dice).

## Raid

A raid is considered favorable if:

- Bot can roll a number of raid dice equal to 2x the number of keys on the target, AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender, OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one battle action available after moving to the target

If favorable, the bot will first spend actions to roll dice like a trophies battle, up to the last action available, when it will roll raid dice.

## Control

A battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per fresh defending ship.

## Outrage

At each step, check for outrage. Bot will not embark on the battle, or will abort the battle under certain circumstances.

- If bot risks outrage in a resource type corresponding to a declared ambition that the bot is <ins>contending</ins> then the battle is not considered favorable.
- If bot risks outrage in a resource type that does NOT correspond to a declared ambition that the bot is <ins>contending</ins>, then the battle is still not considered favorable, UNLESS bot could ransack the court after trigging outrage.
