# "Favorable Battle"

When evaluating a bot turn you may be asked if the bot can conduct a "favorable battle" to achieve some result. Use the following guidelines to determine if the bot will conduct the action.

First, identify the goal. This will always be one of the following:
- Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to contend an ambition
- Trophies for warlord
- Control of a system

Once identified, follow the procedure corresponding to the goal below.

## Raid

A raid is considered favorable if bot can:

- Roll a number of raid dice equal to 2x the number of keys on the target, AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender, OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one battle action available after moving to the target

## Trophies

A battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot can roll any number of dice, and bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships.

## Control

A battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per fresh defending ship.
