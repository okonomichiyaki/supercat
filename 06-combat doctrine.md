# Combat Doctrine

When asked if bot can <ins>favorable combat</ins> to achieve some result, first identify the goal, then refer to the corresponding section below. Goal will always be one of:

- Trophies for warlord
- Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to <ins>contend</ins> an ambition
- Control of a system

## Trophies

A Battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1 ratio of fresh ships.

If bot has multiple actions, first roll skirmish dice until ratio of fresh ships is better than 1:1, or only 1 action left. Then roll all assault dice if ratio is better than 1:1, or select half skirmish dice and half assault dice (round in favor of skirmish dice). Allocate hits prioritizing trophies.

## Raid

A raid is considered favorable if bot can roll raid dice equal to 2x the number of keys on the target AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one Battle action available after moving to the target.

If favorable, the bot will first spend actions to roll dice like a trophies Battle, up to the last action available, when it will roll raid dice.

## Control

A Battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per fresh defending ship.

If favorable, bot will select dice like a trophies Battle. Bot will allocate hits to take control, then allocate hits to take trophies.

## Outrage

Prior to Battle, check for risk of outrage. Battle not considered favorable if outrage would cause bot to stop <ins>contending</ins> a declared ambition. Otherwise, Battle which risks outrage is only considered favorable if bot could ransack the court after trigging outrage.
