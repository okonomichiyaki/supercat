# Empire Affinity

## Strong

bot always wants to stay a Regent or become a Regent

- if Regent and not First Regent:
	- check if exposed to "Govern the Imperial Reach" -- does bot have piece for Demand or at least 1 agent in supply?
- if Outlaw:
	- either:
		- get a Favor from First Regent
		- call Summit
		- return Favor to force invite to Empire
	- or:
		- call Summit
		- negotiate with First Regent to invite
		- bot-bot negotiation is covered
		- but if player is First Regent, need special case for bot-human negotiation?

## Neutral

randomly determine if bot will stay a Regent or become an Outlaw
track grievance vs empire?

## Weak/Anti-Empire

bot always wants to become an Outlaw

- if Regent:
	- play Event -> get Initiative -> call Summit
	- Influence & Secure Imperial Council -> call Summit
	- call Summit -> Leave the Empire
