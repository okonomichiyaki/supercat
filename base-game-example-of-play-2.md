continuing the example, at the start of the next round it's yellow bot's turn, so once again start with the "Bot turn" page. yellow bot still has no bonus cards, but has initiative, so after drawing 2 cards and decrementing the hand counter...

[example 07]

... consult the nested procedures under [i]✦ Does bot have initiative?[/i]. yellow bot still has no seize counter, but these are true:

[q][i]
• Is bot winning or tied for first place for a matching ambition?
◦ Is there an ambition marker available?
[/i][/q]

yellow bot drew a 6 which corresponds to the Empath ambition. yellow bot is currently winning (it has two Psionic resources, and no one else has any) and there are markers available. follow the instructions to declare, placing the zero marker as usual:

[q][i]
Select matching card and declare, if bot is winning or ambition not yet declared.
[/i][/q]

*(the conditional clause here checks to see if the ambition was already declared or the bot is tied for first. the bot will only declare an ambition which was already declared, placing a second or third marker in the box, if the bot is winning the ambition outright. but it will declare an undeclared ambition if it's tied for first place. this isn't relevant in this case since yellow bot is winning and the ambition is undeclared)*

just like when the bot can Surpass, if the bot is in a situation where it wants to declare an ambition, skip General Priorities and select the card directly. check for Prelude actions as usual, then turn to the page for the selected suit. in this case, the bot only has Psionic resources, and the Prelude rules tell us:

[q][i]
Bot will not spend resources or Guild cards matching a declared ambition
[/i][/q]

and since Empath is now declared the bot will hold on to its Psionics. the page for Mobilization asks the following:

[q][i]
✦ Does bot have no starport and no claims?
✦ Are any loyal buildings controlled by a rival?
✦ Does bot have unbuilt cities and fewer claims than unbuilt cities?
✦ Can bot use an ability on a ready Guild or lore card?
[/i][/q]

These all evaluate to false, because the bot has a starport, none of the bot buildings are controlled by a rival, and although the bot has unbuilt cities, it has 4 unbuilt cities and already has 4 claims. So continue reading to the next question:

[q][i]✦ Can bot Influence a card?[/i][/q]

The bot has agents available, so it is able to influence a card, but there are multiple options. The preferences below this procedure help prioritize:

[q][i]
- defend Loyal agents on contested card
- icon to contend a declared ambition, if Secured
- icon to contend an undeclared ambition, if Secured
- effective Vox
- icon to grow a lead in a declared ambition
[/i][/q]

There are no agents in the Court yet, so we can skip the first item. Earlier, we glossed over the special meaning behind the word "contend" which is important to understand when following these procedures. In the context of this non-player system, "contend" means "take an action causing the bot to improve its position with respect to an ambition AND bot will be either winning or tied for first or second place." Recall that the initial court cards are: Mass Uprising (Vox), Shipping Interest (Fuel), Admin Union (Material), and Sworn Guardians (Relic). None of these are Psionics, so we can skip the second item as well since Empath is the only declared ambition.

No cards have been Secured and no resources spent or gained, so the current situation is just the starting resources: red has a Weapon and a Relic, Yellow as two Psionics, and Blue has a Relic and a Material:

[picture]

if yellow bot were to Secure either Shipping Interest or Admin Union it would tie for first place with blue for an undeclared ambition (Tycoon). if yellow bot were to Secure Sworn Guardians it would be a three-way tie with blue and red bot for first place in Keeper which is also undeclared. Securing any of of these cards would result in yellow bot being tied for first place. so all three Guild cards are eligible options here.

Like movement, the "Influence Principles" have further guidance on how the bot will influence cards. this page also includes a list of priorities to help resolve multiple options:

[q][i]
- uncontested card
- card granting a bonus action card (for example Union card or "Call to Action" Vox card)
- Weapon icon
- card which would take most captives
- Loyal card for outraged resource
[/i][/q]

all of the cards are uncontested (another special term which just means there are no agents on the card) so we go to the next preference for this procedure which helps narrow the options: it says the bot will prefer a "card granting a bonus action card". The Union cards have a Prelude ability which can take a played action card, so this narrows the options to the Admin Union. the first part of the Influence Principles explains how the bot influences:

[q][i]
If possible, influence uncontested cards with 2 agents. Otherwise, influence uncontested cards with 1 agent.
[/i][/q]

yellow bot has 3 actions (only 2 pips, but still getting a bonus due to difficulty level), so it will influence the Admin Union card with 2 agents. the bot has one more action left, and like in previous turns we don't need to re-evaluate its options from the start of the page as nothing has changed in the board state which would make the earlier options valid, so we know the bot will prioritize influencing another card, using the same priorities. the other two options, Shipping Interest and Sworn Guardians, are still relevant, but none of the priorities on the Influence Principles will resolve the decision, so we use the final tie breaker:

[q][i]
If further tie breaking is necessary, prefer the card with more keys.
[/i][/q]

Shipping Interest has 2 keys vs Sworn Guardians 1 key, so yellow bot influences Shipping Interest with its last action.

[image]

yellow bot passes the turn to blue, who Surpasses with the 4 of Mobilization and influences Shipping Union with 2 agents, hoping to take the initiative and follow up with a Secure to take a yellow agent captive, and moves to take control of Gate 3.

it's red bot's turn, and red bot draws the 5 of Mobilization, which allows it to Surpass as well:

[example 11]

i'll skip the detailed walkthrough for red's turn here, as it is very similar to yellow bot's. in this case, because red already has a Relic resource, it influences Sworn Guardians following this preference on the Mobilization page:

[q][i]
- icon to contend an undeclared ambition, if Secured
[/i][/q]

because if red bot were to Secure the card, it would have 2 Relics to blue's 1, and win the undeclared ambition Keeper. red bot also influences Mass Uprising with its 3rd action because it's an "effective" Vox card. this is another key term which just means that the bot can take full advantage of the card's effects. *(for additional clarification there is also a page dedicated to Vox cards which explains the circumstances when each card is effective and how to carry out the text. for "Mass Uprising" it explains: "Effective if bot has 4 or more ships in its supply" which is true for red bot at this time)*

red bot takes the initiative this round, and this is the board state at the end of the round:

[example 12]

red bot begins the next round by drawing the following 2 cards:

[example 13]

hopefully this part of the process is becoming familiar:

[q][i]
✦ Does bot have initiative?
- Remove seize counter, if present.
- Is bot winning or tied for first place for a matching ambition?
- Is there an ambition marker available?
- Select matching card and declare, if bot is winning or ambition not yet declared.
[/i][/q]

Red bot is currently tied for first place for Seeker, which matches the 5 of Aggression it has drawn, so that is the card selected, and the ambition is declared. before turning to the Aggression page, we check for Prelude actions, and find specific instructions for this situation:

[q][i]
- if Seeker is declared do not spend Relic resources or Guild cards, UNLESS securing a Relic card
...
**Relic**: Secure for captives, contend a declared ambition, or effective Vox card.
[/i][/q]

So Red bot will spend its starting Relic to secure Sworn Guardian:

[example 14]

Now, turn to the page for Aggression to execute the red bot turn as normal. starting from the top, skip the first line because it does not apply:

[q][i]✦ Can bot Secure to contend a declared ambition?[/i][/q]

(red bot would have done this if it had not just used the Relic)
the next line applies, as red bot can Secure Mass Uprising, which is effective as we already established:

[q][i]
✦ Can bot Secure an effective Vox card?
[/i][/q]

The page dedicated to Vox cards explains how to carry out the "When Secured" text: "Prefer cluster with task force." The "task force" is short hand for the group of loyal ships with the most fresh ships. In this case, there are two groups each with 3 fresh ships, so after picking one of the two at random, we place 4 red ships in cluster 3:

[example 15]

the next procedure involves some new concepts, and i will walk through this in detail:

[q][i]
Can bot favorable combat to contend a declared ambition?
[/i][/q]

"Favorable combat" is another special term which describes how the bot will decide when to conduct Battle actions. what it means for a battle to be "favorable" is both subjective and also highly dependent on the board state, but i've tried to construct some basic rules for the bot to follow which aim to be a good balance of smart tactics while also being easy to follow. these are described on the page titled "Combat Principles". the first thing that page says is:

[q][i]When asked if bot can favorable combat to achieve some result, first identify the goal, then refer to the corresponding section below.[/i][/q]

in this case, we're trying to determine if red bot can contend a declared ambition with a Battle action. Empath was declared, and yellow bot is holding 2 Psionics while being right next to red bot's starport:

[example 16]

the rules for a favorable raid are:

[q][i]
A raid is considered favorable if bot can roll raid dice equal to 2x keys on the target AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to defender OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one Battle action available after moving to the target.
[/i][/q]

red bot has 2 actions left on this card, and can move 3 ships and roll 4 raid dice (note that it still gets the bonus from "Elite Pilots" even when acting against another bot). yellow bot has 1 Psionic in a 1 key slot on its board, so that is enough for red bot to consider this a favorable raid, except that there is an additional clause for outrage:

[q][i]
A combat which risks outrages is only favorable if bot could ransack the court AND if outrage would not cause bot to stop contending a declared ambition.
[/i][/q]

Even though we are evaluating this raid for the purpose of declared Empath, since red has no Psionics, if red bot were to outrage Psionics, it would not discard anything and therefore there would be no change in contention. The second sentence applies: the bot will only risk outrage if there is a target for ransack. In this case, yellow has agents on the court, so red bot will risk it.

following the Combat doctrine for dice selection, red bot will move (first action), then roll raid dice (second action), and gets enough keys to steal a Psionic but also does trigger outrage:

[example 17]

first, red bot applies 2 hits to attacking ships, following "Combat principles" which says to apply hits to take or neutralize control. taking 2 hits by destroying an attacking ship results in no control. there's no decisions to make about hits to the city, it's destroyed, triggering outrage and resulting in red bot ransacking the Court. "Combat principles" tells us to ransack for more trophies, so red bot takes Shipping Interest and takes 3 trophies. finally red bot spend the key to take a Psionic, placing the new resource in the 3 key slot. although there are no instructions for where to place new resources, usually it's obvious so i make the decision for the bot.

[example 18]

i will follow this post with one more example, to cover a couple important things
