# Influence Principles

When Influencing cards in the court, the bot will follow these guidelines.

If possible, influence uncontested cards with 2 agents. Otherwise, influence uncontested cards with 1 agent. If possible, Influence contested cards with 1 more agent than Rival with most agents.

Defending Loyal agents on a contested card means preventing their capture by a Rival who could Secure the card. When defending Loyal agents, roll 1d6 and compare the result to the most Rival agents currently on the card.

- If the die roll is greater than most Rival agents, Outbid:
	- Influence with one more agent than Rival with most agents
- If die roll is equal to most Rival agents Block:
	- Influence with agents up to Rival with most agents, but first:
		- Check if bot would have no agents remaining, then Abandon instead.
- If die roll is less than most Rival agents, Abandon:
	- Do not Influence card at all

### Critical Court cards

When procedures direct bot to Influence or Secure a Critical Court card, select cards from the priority list below.

- an adverse Vox card (Vox card with a Crisis which negatively impacts bot)
- a card which would result in bot contending a declared ambition, if Secured
- an effective Vox card
- a card granting any bonus action card
- any non-Vox card with any other non-Vox card attached to it

### Tie-breaking

Use the following priorities to select between two or more cards of equal priority:

- uncontested card
- card with attached Faithful, Guild, or lore card
- card which would take most captives
- "Loyal" card matching an Outrage type
- card with more keys
