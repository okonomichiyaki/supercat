### Components

- 36 wooden letter tiles:
	- 9 vowels (or all the same letter)
	- 27 consonants (or all the same letter, but a different letter from first set of 18)

The letters do not matter, what matters is that you have 36 pieces which can be turned face down to hide their value, and that you have 9 of one value and 27 of another value.

For the purpose of these rules and examples, it will be assumed that you have 9 vowels and 27 consonants. The vowels represent a successful clue and the consonants represent an unsuccessful clue.

### Setup

(1) Organize 18 of the tiles into 3 facedown groups of 6 each:

- one group of 6 vowels
- two groups of 6 consonants each

Set aside the other 18 tiles for now.

(2) Keeping the groups distinct, randomize them such that the player does not know which group is which. This requires a little care to avoid turning tiles over or accidentally co-mingling the groups. After this step, you should have 3 facedown groups, each with 6 tiles, and each group should still consist of all the same kind of tile, but the player should not know what kind of tiles are contained in each group.

(3) Starting with one of the groups and keeping the tiles facedown, place one tile from this group in each of the planets with a hex symbol. Repeat this with another group and the arrow planets, and finally with the last group and the moon planets. After this step, each planet will have a single facedown tile, and all the planets with the same symbol will have tiles which originated from the same group.

(4) Organize the remaining tiles into 6 facedown groups of 3 each:

- one group of 3 vowels
- five groups of 3 consonants each

(5) Just as in step 4, randomize these groups such that the player does not know which group is which but the groups remain distinct.

(6) Again, like in step 3, take one of the groups and place them on the map, keeping them facedown. Place one tile from this group in each planet of a cluster. Repeat this step for each cluster, so that each cluster gets tiles its own group.

(7) Each planet should now have 2 facedown tiles, one from step 3 and one from step 6. Optionally mix the two tiles at each planet so that the player does not know which tile came from which step (at this step no tile is changing the planet it is assigned to. the 2 tiles on each planet should just be indistinguishable from each other)

### Uncovering Clues

After the above setup is complete, one of the 18 planets has 2 vowel tiles, the other planets in the same cluster have 1 vowel, and the other planets with the matching symbol have 1 vowel. All other planets have 2 consonant tiles. The Portal is located on the planet with with 2 vowels.

Each time the Prelude ability on "Uncovering Clues" is used, turn over both tiles at the target planet. If both of the tiles are vowels, place the Portal token; it has been found. If only one of the tiles is a vowel, place a Clue token with the "check" side face up. If both tiles are consonants, place a Clue token with the "x" side face up. These Clue tokens retain their original meaning as described on the cards "Uncovering Clues" and "Clues to the Portal" (F9-03).
