## Find the Portal Minigames

There are two different minigames which make it possible for the Pathfinder to be used in a solo game. Both minigames retain all the mechanics of the Portal and the Clue tokens, and enable either the player or the bot to play the Pathfinder. The Portal is still secretly located on one of the planets, and the meaning of the Clue tokens is exactly the same as described on the cards "Uncovering Clues" and "Clues to the Portal" (F9-03).

Each minigame has slightly different pros and cons, and you may prefer one over the other due to components or ease of setup vs ease of play. See the following pages for details on the minigames. Select one during setup of Act II, and use the minigame when performing the Prelude ability on "Uncovering Clues" (F9-02).

## Act II

✦ Has the Portal been found? *(is the Portal token on the map?)*

- Yes:
	- Can bot Build, Repair, or Move to control the Portal?
- No:
	- Select planets meeting the Clue guidelines below. Does bot have a resource eligible for Uncovering Clues on one of the planets? *(a resource different from all planets in the cluster)*
		- Yes:
			- Can bot Move the Flagship to that planet? (use partial move)
		- No:
			- Can bot Tax or favorable battle to gain a resource eligible for Uncovering Clues on one of the planets?

Uncovering Clues
: Use Prelude ability if current planet meets Clue Guidelines

## Act III

✦ Can bot Move, Build, Repair, or favorable combat for control of the Portal token?

✦ Can bot use Pilgrims' Use the Portal (Move) ability?

✦ Doe the Empire control the Portal token?

- Is bot a Regent, but not the First Regent?
	- Can bot Influence or Secure the Imperial Council?

Pilgrims (Prelude)
: Prior to using this ability, if bot has a Slipstream Drive and can Catapult either the Flagship or ships from the Flagship which will enable a Pilgrim token to move closer to the Portal, then the bot will do that first (Prefer: ships Catapulting for control). Afterwards, use this ability to move as many Pilgrim tokens as possible closer to the Portal.

Movement Principles
: If bot currently controls the Portal, do not abandon control when evaluating Move actions for other reasons.

## Clue Guidelines

✦ Use these guidelines to select planets for Uncovering Clues, according to the number of Clue tokens already on the map.

✦ How many Clue tokens are on the map?

- None: select any planet
- One: select planets with different symbols and in a different clusters from Clue token
- Two or more:
	- Has the Portal's symbol and cluster been deduced?
		- select identified planet
	- Has the Portal's symbol been deduced?
		- select planet in a cluster with no Clue token
	- Otherwise:
		- select planet which is a possible Portal location
