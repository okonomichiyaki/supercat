### Clue Guidelines

Bot will follow these guidelines when selecting planets to target for Clue tokens.
If it's not possible for bot to take actions above which meet these guidelines, then bot will continue to prioritize other actions. *(in other words, these are not preferences and do not select random planets if there is no planet meeting the guidelines)*

- If there are no Clue tokens on the map:
	- any planet
- If the Portal's symbol and cluster has been deduced:

		- planet with a symbol not matching a planet with a Clue token
		- planet in a cluster with no Clue tokens in that cluster
