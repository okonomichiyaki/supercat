## contending

The concept of contending ambitions is important. This is a special keyword in the context of this non-player system: to contend an ambition means take any action which improves the bot's position for that ambition resulting in the bot taking second or first place, including ties.

There is an important difference between contending an ambition and "winning or tied for first place", which is that contending also includes second place and tied for second place. Note that the bot will only declare an undeclared ambition if it is winning or tied for first place; it will not declare an ambition if it is in second place.

Furthermore, the bot will only declare an ambition which has already been declared (double or triple declare to add second or third marker to the ambition box) if it is **winning** the ambition. It will not double or triple declare if it is tied for first place.

## decision making and breaking ties

When the bot needs to make a decision but there are multiple options, the solo player may need to make some decisions. Ideally this should only be required of the player infrequently. When in doubt, follow these rules which should resolve multiple options for the bot.

Actions
: When selecting an action from multiple options to achieve the same goal, actions will be listed in priority order. For example, in the procedure "Can bot Secure or Tax to contend declared ambition", the bot will prefer to Secure rather than Tax if both are an option.

Goals
: Similarly, there are multiple goals, they are also listed in priority order. For example, in the procedure "Can bot Secure to contend an undeclared ambition, to take captives, or to grow lead in declared ambition", the bot will prefer to contend an undeclared ambition before growing a lead in a declared ambition.

Prefer
: Some actions have extra guidance in the form of "preferences", indicated with the word "Prefer" and a list of priorities. Use these priorities to decide between multiple options. Narrow the possibilities to only those which meet the first priority, then the second priority, and so on, until only one option remains.

Random
: If the bot has multiple options and the procedures do not give explicit preferences, or those priorities fail to differentiate between the options, the bot will always pick randomly with equal odds of each option.
