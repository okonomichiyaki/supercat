# Clarifications

The concept of contending ambitions is important. This is a special keyword: to contend an ambition means take any action which improves the bot's position for that ambition such that the bot takes first or second place, including ties.

There is a difference between contending an ambition and "winning or tied for first place", which is that contending also includes second place and ties for second place. The bot will only declare an undeclared ambition if it is winning or tied for first place; it will not declare an ambition if it is in second place.

Furthermore, the bot will only declare an ambition which has already been declared (double or triple declare to add second or third marker to the ambition box) if it is **winning** the ambition. It will not double or triple declare if it is tied for first place.
