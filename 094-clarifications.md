# Clarifications

The concept of contending ambitions is important. This is a special keyword in the context of this non-player system: to contend an ambition means take any action which improves the bot's position for that ambition resulting in the bot taking second or first place, including ties.

There is an important difference between contending an ambition and "winning or tied for first place", which is that contending also includes second place and tied for second place. Note that the bot will only declare an undeclared ambition if it is winning or tied for first place; it will not declare an ambition if it is in second place.

Furthermore, the bot will only declare an ambition already declared (i.e. double or triple declare to add second or third marker) if it is winning the ambition. It will not double or triple declare if it is tied for first place.
