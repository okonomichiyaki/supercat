# Restrictions

Bot will spend resources and guild cards during its prelude, but only in certain situations.
If bot is contending for a declared ambition and spending a resource or guild card will take it out of contention, it will not spend that resource or guild card.

Specifically:
- if tycoon is declared AND bot is contending for tycoon then do not spend fuel or material resources or guild cards
- if empath is declared AND bot is contending for empath then do not spend psionic resources or guild cards
- if seeker is declared AND bot is contending for seeker then do not spend relic resources or guild cards, UNLESS doing securing another relic card

# Resources

**Fuel and Weapon**: spend for combat card

**Relic**: Secure guild card to take captives or contend for a declared ambition

**Psionic**: Tax/Secure to contend for a declared ambition, or spend for combat card

# Guild cards
