✦ Is the Imperial Council in session?

- Can bot Influence or Secure the Imperial Council?

✦ Can bot tax for any resource?

## Event cards

Event cards are always considered <ins>effective</ins>.

## Summit Negotiations

During the negotiation minigame, on the bot's turn it will use 2 negotiation rounds instead of only 1. The bot will use this second round even if the first round succeeds. The bot will offer according to procedures described in the minigame, however the bot will only accept resources or favors. 

If the bot has 3 or more resources at the end of the negotiation minigame, then discard 3 resources to advance objective, unless bot is currently winning a declared ambition matching those resources.

Do not spend resources for any Prelude actions if bot has 3 or fewer resources.
