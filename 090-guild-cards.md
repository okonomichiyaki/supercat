# Guild Cards

In all cases, follow the same guidelines as for spending resources for Prelude action. Do not discard a card for the ability if ambition matching a card's icon is declared. Othereise, use ability as described below.

Lattice Spies
: Bot will use Prelude ability if seize roll passes.

Farseers
: Bot will use Prelude ability at first opportunity. Discard Farseers (and no action cards) and gain one extra action card. If player controls Farseers and declares an ambition, look at a number of cards from the bottom of the action draw stack equal to the bot's hand counter, and swap one. Then shuffle the stack.

Silver Tongues
: Bot will use Prelude ability if it causes bot to win a declared ambition.
