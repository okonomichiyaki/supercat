# Guild Cards

In all cases, follow the same guidelines as for resources in bot's prelude: do not discard a card if bot is contending for an ambition matching a card's icon. If bot is not contending for a matching ambition, use prelude ability as described below.

Lattice Spies
: bot will use prelude ability if seize roll passes

Farseers
: bot will use prelude ability at first opportunity. discard Farseers only to gain one extra action card. if player controls Farseers and declares ambition, look at a number of cards from the bottom of the action draw stack equal to the bot's hand counter, and swap one. then shuffle the stack.

Silver Tongues
: bot will use prelude ability if it causes bot to win a declared ambition
