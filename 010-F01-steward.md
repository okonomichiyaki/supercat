✦ Are there any clusters where the Empire does not control any systems?

- Can bot Move to get Empire control in a system in one of these clusters?

✦ Does a rival have more cities than bot?

- Can bot Build a city?
- If bot would have most cities by building a double city, ignore usual restriction on double cities. *(build even if not winning a declared ambition and not uncovering bonus power)*

✦ Does a rival have more starports than bot?

- Can bot Build a starport to have the most starports built (including ties)?

Govern the Imperial Reach
: Prefer Policy of Peace or Policy of Escalation

Imperial Quorum
: When the Regent with the most starports is a bot, it will always take the Imperial action, except if the policy is Policy of Peace and the bot would gain less power than any other rival. When the Regent with the most cities is a bot, check the Fate to see if it will change the policy.
