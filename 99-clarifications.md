# Clarifications

There is difference between <ins>contending</ins> an ambition and winning or tied for first place: <ins>contending</ins> also includes second place. Bot will only declare an ambition if it is winning or tied for first place; it will not declare an ambition if it is in second place. However, bot will take often take an action if that action can cause the bot to get to second place.

Bot will only declare an ambition already declared (i.e. double or triple declare to add second or third marker) if it is winning the ambition. It will not double or triple declare if it is tied for first place.

Bot will not reset the seize counter between chapters. If a chapter ends and seize counter is at 4 or greater, bot will seize at the first opportunity in the next chapter.

Bot will reset the seize counter if it surpasses, even if a player or bot later in turn order plays a higher numbered card.
