# how to play with SUPERCAT

## Components

You will need some mechanism to track two numeric values per bot, for instance two dice of different colors rotated to show a specific number face up. They are referred to as "counters" in the rules.

## Setup

- Select a setup card based on player count.
- The player(s) will always be last in turn order and bot(s) first.
- Place pieces on the board per setup card accordingly.
- Place starting resources on both player and bot boards per set up card.
- Deal cards according to rules below.

## Playing a chapter

SUPERCAT does not have a normal hand of 6 cards. At the beginning of a chapter, shuffle the action deck and deal the player(s) 6 cards. Place the remaining cards in a face down stack. Then place a counter on each bot's board, with a value of 6. This represents the number of cards in the bot's hand. On the bot's turn, reveal two cards from this stack. The bot will play one of these cards, and discard the other. The procedures on the following pages will instruct you on how to select a card, and how to execute the bot's turn.

After bot's turn, decrement the hand counter. If at any time the stack runs out, shuffle the discard pile before drawing. If at any time the bot gains a card (e.g. Union cards or Vox card "Call to Action") place the card near the bot's player board, and increment the hand counter. Play the action card gained as the last card of the round. When the bot seizes initiative, decrement the counter to represent the bot discarding an extra card. Continue playing as normal, until the player has no cards (or has passed initiative) and each bot's hand counter is at zero.

## Additional advantages

At the beginning of a chapter, check the relative power of the bot(s) and player. If a bot is not ahead of the player, during this chapter the bot will gain the following advantages:

- Efficient Logistics: bot has 1 extra action per card
	- if lead card: number of pips plus 1
	- if pivot or copy: 2 actions
- Elite Pilots: bot collects 1 extra die during battle

In this context, tied for first place does not count as ahead, so these advantages apply at the start of a game to all bots.

For a harder game:

- Apply the above advantages even if the bot is ahead in power.
- The bot with the most power starts every chapter with initiative.

For an easier game:

- Do not apply the above advantages even if the bot is behind in power.
- Randomly assign initiative at the start of the game.

## How to follow the procedures

The procedures use some special vocabulary that is specific to SUPERCAT. See the "Terminology" page for explanations of words like <ins>contend</ins>.

Start with the "Bot Turn" page and read from top to bottom. Follow the instructions, executing statements if possible. When posed with a yes or no question, evaluate the situation, and follow the nested steps.

When taking actions using multiple pips from a card, follow the procedures to take as many actions as indicated. If action pips remain, restart the procedure from the top, re-evaluating questions from top to bottom.
