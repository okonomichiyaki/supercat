# how to play with SUPERCAT

## Components

You will need some mechanism to track two numeric values per bot, for instance two dice of different colors rotated to show a specific number face up.

## Setup

- Select a setup card depending on the desired player count.
- Determine player order:
	- The player will always be last in turn order.
	- If playing with multiple players, bot(s) will always be ahead of players in turn order.
- Give one of the bots the initiative marker
- Place pieces on the board per setup card
- Deal cards to players (not bots) as described below
- Ignore mulligan rules in a 2 player game (player vs bot)

## Playing a chapter

SUPERCAT does not have a normal hand of 6 cards. At the beginning of a chapter, shuffle the action deck and deal the player 6 cards. Place the remaining cards in a face down stack. Then place one die on each bot's player board, showing the 6 face. This represents the number of cards in the bot's hand. On the bot's turn, reveal two cards from this stack. The bot will play one of these cards, and discard the other. The procedures on the following pages will instruct you on how to select a card.

After the bot's turn, decrement the hand counter. If at any time the stack runs out, shuffle the discard pile before drawing. If at any time the bot gains a card (e.g. Union cards or Vox card "Call to Action") place the card near the bot's player board, and increment the hand counter. Play the action card gained as the last card of the round. When the bot seizes initiative, decrement the counter to represent the bot discarding an extra card. Continue playing as normal, until the player as no cards (or has passed initiative) and all bot's hand counters are 0.

## Additional advantages

At the beginning of a chapter, check the relative power of the bot(s) and player. If a bot is not winning, during this chapter the bot will gain the following advantages:

- Efficient logistics: bot has 1 extra action per card
	- if the lead card, number of pips plus 1
	- if pivot or copy, 2 actions
- Elite pilots: bot collects 1 extra die during battle

In this context, tied for first place does not count as winning, so these advantages should apply at the start of a game to all bots.

For a harder game:

- apply the above advantages even if the bot is winning in power
- the bot with the most power starts every chapter with initiative

For an easier game:

- do not apply the above advantaged even if the bot is lowing in power
- randomly assign initiative at the start of the game

## How to follow the procedures

Starting with the "Bot Turn" page, read from top to bottom.
Follow the instructions, executing statements if possible.
When posed with a yes or no question, evaluate the situation, and follow the nested steps.
If the answer is "yes", and there is a marked sub-section, follow it.
If there is no marked sub-section, the question should have an obvious, simple action to follow.
Take that action.
If the answer is "no", and there is a marked sub-section, follow it.
If there is none, continue reading down the page to the next question.

When taking actions using multiple pips from a card, follow the procedures to take as many actions as indicated. If action pips remain, restart the procedure from the top, re-evaluating questions from top to bottom.
