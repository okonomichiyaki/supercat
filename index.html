<h1 class="title">SUPERCAT</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="a-procedural-non-player-system-for-solo-arcs">a procedural
non-player system for solo Arcs</h2>
<p><em>version 0.9-draft</em></p>
<p>This is a non-player system, or “bot”, for playing the board game
Arcs. It’s intended for solitaire play, i.e. one human playing against
one or more bots. Although it can also work as the 3rd or 4th opponent
in a multiplayer game, using it in this way has not been tested
thoroughly.</p>
<p>SUPERCAT is not an “automa” but is instead a simulation-style bot.
Rather than streamline any mechanics, it attempts to interact with all
of the rules of the original game using conditional procedures which
mimic a human opponent. The bot deviates from the rules in a few
important ways, but will follow every other rule in the game apart from
these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>the bot’s hand of cards is abstracted to retain some uncertainty and
“fog of war”</li>
<li>there are optional difficulty modifiers to make the solo experience
more challenging</li>
<li>some Fates use special rules for mechanics which are awkward in a
solo context</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules will always refer to the human player as the “player”,
and will refer to the non-player system exclusively as the “bot”. The
word “player” never refers to a bot.</p>
<p>There are two versions of this document; this is the Blighted Reach
campaign version. <em>(note: it currently only supports “A” and “B”
Fates through Act II)</em></p>
<p>If this is your first time playing Arcs using SUPERCAT, consider
playing at least one chapter of the base game with the bot before using
it to play the campaign.</p>
<p><em>Arcs was designed by Cole Wehrle and published by Leder
Games.</em> <br> <em>SUPERCAT is an unofficial fan project, and is not
affiliated with Leder Games.</em></p>
<h2 id="components">Components</h2>
<p>You will need some way to track several values per bot, for instance
dice of different colors rotated to show a different number faceup.
These can be six sided dice (only in rare situations will the values
exceed six) but could also be eight or ten sided dice (they are never
rolled). These are referred to as “counters” in the rules that
follow.</p>
<p>You will need at least two counters per bot, and if playing with the
optional Grievances rule (a new mechanic introduced by this solo mode),
you will also need extra counters for each bot, which depend on the
number of bots in the game. At most you will need one red, blue, yellow,
and white counter for each bot. <em>(some Fates require additional
components: see Pathfinder for details)</em></p>
<h2 id="act-i-setup">Act I Setup</h2>
<p>Set up the game according to the Blighted Reach rulebook, but make
changes at the steps listed below. See “Difficulty Modifiers” section
for more details on optional steps.</p>
<p><strong>1.B.</strong> (optional) Give the initiative marker to a bot,
and seat the player last in turn order.</p>
<p><strong>2.B.</strong> Assign “A” Fates using any method you like.
<em>(suggestion: the player draws 2 “A” Fate cards and chooses one, then
randomly assign each bot an “A” Fate card)</em></p>
<p><strong>2.G-H.</strong> When the bot places a building, randomly
select an empty building slot from among those eligible. The first
building each bot places will be a city and the second will be a
starport. <em>If a bot is the Believer, check that Fate’s procedures for
special instructions.</em> (optional) Place an extra ship in each system
with bot pieces and give each bot one random resource.</p>
<p><strong>2.J.</strong> Deal 6 cards to each player, but do not deal
cards to the bot(s). Place a counter on each bot’s board showing a value
of 6 faceup.</p>
<p><strong>2.K.</strong> Place all action cards not in player hands in a
single face down stack next to the board.</p>
<h2 id="playing-a-chapter">Playing a chapter</h2>
<p>The bot does not hold a hand of action cards. Instead, the bot’s
cards are abstracted by a counter and a facedown stack of all remaining
action cards. This stack is shared by all bots, but each bot has its own
counter, representing that bot’s hand.</p>
<p>Each bot’s counter starts the chapter at 6 and will be decremented
when the bot plays a card. If the bot seizes initiative, the counter
will be decremented a second time, to represent the bot playing an extra
card facedown. If the bot receives a “bonus” card the counter will be
incremented (for example, from the “Call to Action” Vox card). This way,
the counter will always show the number of cards remaining in the bot’s
“virtual” hand. <em>(when the counter is on 1, decrement by removing the
counter)</em></p>
<p>If at any time the stack runs out, shuffle the discard pile
(excluding Event cards) before drawing cards for the bot. Continue until
the player has no cards and each bot’s hand counter is at zero, at which
point the chapter ends.</p>
<p>At the end of the chapter, shuffle all action cards from the discard
pile, any remaining in the stack, and any set aside Event cards before
dealing cards to the player(s).</p>
<h2 id="playing-a-bot-turn">Playing a bot turn</h2>
<p>At the start of a bot’s turn, check the hand counter. If it is
showing 1 or greater, the bot has cards remaining and will play one.
Draw 2 action cards from the facedown stack and decrement the counter.
The procedures on the “Bot Turn” page will select one of the cards for
the bot to play, and also determine whether the bot declares an ambition
or seizes the initiative. At that point, discard the other card, and
continue with the procedures to execute the bot’s turn.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-cards">Bonus cards</h3>
<p>When the bot receives a bonus action card, place the new card in the
bot’s play area and increment the bot’s hand counter. On subsequent
turns, prior to drawing 2 cards from the facedown stack, compare how
many bonus cards the bot has to the hand counter’s current value. If the
counter is showing a value greater than the number of bonus cards, the
bot will draw 2 cards from the facedown stack. If the counter is equal
to the number of bonus cards, the bot will not draw 2 cards. Either way,
decrement the hand counter.</p>
<p>Then the bot will then select a card to play from among all available
cards: any bonus cards in the bot’s play area plus any drawn cards.
Evaluate all cards equally according to the procedures. After a card is
selected, discard any drawn cards which were not selected. Do not
discard bonus cards from the bot’s play area until they have been
selected and played.</p>
<h3 id="prelude">Prelude</h3>
<p>After the bot has selected a card, consult the guidelines for Prelude
actions, and spend any resources or Guild cards for their effect now.
After the bot completes the Prelude, go to the page for the selected
card’s suit, and execute the bot’s actions using the procedures on that
page.</p>
<h3 id="guild-and-lore-cards">Guild and Lore Cards</h3>
<p>The bot will use <strong>new actions</strong> on Guild and lore
cards, like <strong>Manufacture (Build)</strong>, at most once per
chapter. When using “General Priorities” to select a card to play, there
is a check to see if the bot can use any abilities on ready Guild cards.
A Guild card is ready if it has not been used this chapter. If the bot
selects a card due to this procedure, mark the Guild card as exhausted
(rotate the card or place a marker on the card). At the end of the
chapter, all cards become ready again (turn the card upright or remove
the marker).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-follow-the-procedures">How to follow the procedures</h2>
<p>Follow each bulleted instruction explicitly, executing statements if
possible. When posed with a question, evaluate the situation and follow
the nested steps. For more detailed explanation of interpreting nested
procedures, see “Questions”.</p>
<p>When directed to use “General Priorities”, select a card from among
the bot’s options and Lead, Pivot, or Copy with the indicated suit. If
the indicated suit is not available, proceed to the next question.</p>
<p>When multiple actions are available to the bot <em>(for example
Leading with a low number card)</em>, first spend actions according to
the highest priority, then if actions remaining, restart the procedures
from the top of that suit’s page.</p>
<p>The procedures use some special vocabulary that is specific to
SUPERCAT. See the “Terminology” page for explanations of words like
<ins>contend</ins>. When rounding any fractions, always round down,
unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Aside from the changes to card play described above, the negotiation
minigame, some special handling of certain Fate abilities, and the
additional advantages granted by difficulty modifiers, the bot will
follow every rule in the game.</p>
<h2 id="decision-making-for-the-bot">Decision making for the bot</h2>
<p>When evaluating the bots options for its turn, there may be some
ambiguity as to which action to take or how to execute a specific
action. The player should only need to make limited decisions on behalf
of the bot. The following rules attempt to resolve multiple options for
the bot as much as possible.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Actions</dt>
<dd>
When different actions can achieve the same goal, select the first
eligible option. For example, in the procedure “Can bot Secure or Tax to
<ins>contend</ins> declared ambition”, the bot will prefer to Secure
rather than Tax if both actions <ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition.
</dd>
<dt>Goals</dt>
<dd>
Similarly, if there are multiple goals, they are also listed in priority
order. For example, in the procedure “Can bot Secure to
<ins>contend</ins> an <ins>undeclared ambition</ins>, to take captives,
or to grow lead in declared ambition”, the bot will prefer to
<ins>contend</ins> an <ins>undeclared ambition</ins> before growing a
lead in a declared ambition.
</dd>
<dt>Prefer</dt>
<dd>
Some actions have extra guidance in the form of “preferences”, indicated
with the word “Prefer” and a list of priorities. Use these priorities to
decide between multiple options. Narrow the possibilities to only those
which meet the first priority, then the second priority, and so on,
until only one option remains.
</dd>
<dt>Principles</dt>
<dd>
There are a set of four “Principles” which the bot will follow when
taking certain actions. Use these to guide the specific actions the bot
will take when Influencing, Moving, engaging in combat, and expanding
the bot’s territory.
</dd>
<dt>Random</dt>
<dd>
If the bot has multiple options and the procedures do not give explicit
preferences, or those priorities fail to differentiate between the
options, pick randomly.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="difficulty-modifiers-optional">Difficulty modifiers
(Optional)</h2>
<p>The procedures try to emulate competent play, but the bot doesn’t
plan multiple cards ahead and makes limited use of Guild and lore cards.
For a more challenging game, start each game with the player last in
turn order, and give the bot some additional advantages when it does not
have more power than the player:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Efficient Logistics</strong>: bot performs 1 extra action
per card</li>
<li><strong>Elite Pilots</strong>: bot collects 1 extra die during
Battle</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: If the bot is tied with the player, it does not have more
power, and will gain these advantages, including at the start of the
game when all power markers are tied at zero.</em></p>
<p>Relative power should be evaluated per bot, so in a game with 2 bots,
if one bot is ahead of the player, and the other is behind, apply these
only to the losing bot. In a multiplayer game, check power between bots
and players: grant the bot advantages when it is behind all players.</p>
<p>These modifiers are recommended and should be considered “normal
mode”, because without these advantages you may find the bot
unsatisfying, especially in games with only 1 bot.</p>
<p>For a harder game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the above advantages even if the bot is ahead in power.</li>
<li>The bot with the most power starts every chapter with
initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p>For extra challenge, mix and match any of the following
modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleet Readiness</strong>: during setup, place 1 extra ship
in each system with bot pieces</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Reserves</strong>: during setup, give bot 1 extra
random resource</li>
<li><strong>Armored Hulls</strong>*: bot’s fresh ships are Tough. they
take 2 hits to damage (but damaged ships only take 1 hit to
destroy)</li>
<li><strong>Energy Shields</strong>*: all bot’s ships are Tough</li>
<li><strong>Carrier Tactics</strong>*: attacker must damage all ships
before destroying any of them</li>
<li><strong>Fortress Vaults</strong>*: treat bot’s 1 key resource slots
as having 2 keys for all purposes</li>
<li><strong>Warp Blockades</strong>: bot controls gates with a single
fresh ship (regardless of number of fresh player ships). if more than
one bot in play, bot with more fresh ships controls the gate</li>
</ul>
<p>*apply only if player is the attacker</p>
<h2 id="fates">Fates</h2>
<p>Each Fate has its own set of procedures and priorities which will
supplement the generic procedures to drive the bot’s behavior. Some
Fates have instructions for specific cards, and some Fates have
additional rules for handling mechanics which pose a complication for
solo play. Others will have general information for how other bots will
interact with the mechanics introduced by the Fate. <em>(for example,
Faithful cards and Golems)</em></p>
<p>Each Fate’s procedures are arranged by Act. When consulting the page
corresponding to the active bot’s Fate, refer to the section for the
current Act only. Check the bot’s Fate <strong>once</strong> each turn
when explicitly directed to, depending on how the bot’s card is
selected:</p>
<ul>
<li>After a card is automatically selected to declare an ambition or
surpass, check the page corresponding to the bot’s Fate, and follow
procedures if applicable.</li>
<li>When using “General Priorities” to select a card, note that the
first line on that page checks the bot’s Fate. Consult the page for the
Fate, and if the procedures apply select the card with the suit matching
the actions listed.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the bot will not take more actions from its Fate page
than <strong>half the number of available actions, rounded up.</strong>
Once it takes that many actions, or is unable to take further actions
from this page, turn to the page for the selected suit and spend the
remaining actions.</p>
<h2 id="event-cards">Event Cards</h2>
<p>After a round ends in which an Event card was played and resolved, do
not add it to the discard pile. Instead, set played Event cards aside
and only shuffle them with the action cards prior to dealing at the
start of the next chapter. <em>(since the action card deck will be
reshuffled mid-round when there are 2 or more bots, this is to ensure
Event cards do not occur more frequently than in multiplayer
games)</em></p>
<h2 id="govern-the-imperial-reach">Govern the Imperial Reach</h2>
<p>If the bot is the First Regent, check the bot’s Fate to determine if
it will change the policy. If Fate does not dictate a policy change,
check if enforcing the current policy would cause bot to
<ins>contend</ins> an ambition. If so, enforce the policy. Otherwise,
change the policy and select policy which, if enforced, would cause bot
to <ins>contend</ins> an ambition.</p>
<p>While enforcing the current policy, if a rival has no pieces for
Imperial Demand and has no agent, roll 1d6 and make the rival an Outlaw
on 5 or 6.</p>
<h2 id="summits">Summits</h2>
<p>If bot is given the opportunity to call a Summit, via Event card or
the Imperial Council, check the bot’s Fate. If Fate does not dictate
behavior for Summits, roll 1d6, +1 for each favor the bot has, and call
a Summit on a result of 5 or 6.</p>
<p>If bot calls a Summit and has one or more favors, during the “Call to
Order” phase, follow these procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return Favors</strong>: Follow these priorities to select
negotiation actions. Return as many as possible, using favors as
efficiently as possible.
<ul>
<li><ins>
contend
</ins>
a declared or <ins>undeclared ambition</ins></li>
<li>advance objective directly or indirectly</li>
<li>cause rival to stop <ins>contending</ins> for a declared
ambition</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Petition the Council, Leave the Empire, Revive the
Empire:</strong> Check Fate</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grievances-optional">Grievances (Optional)</h2>
<p>This should be considered an optional but recommended rule. It will
add a little bit of extra friction for the solo player as well as some
texture to the negotiation minigame.</p>
<p>Each bot will have a grievance counter matching the colors of all
other bots and players. For instance, in a game with 1 player and 3
bots, a bot using the red pieces will track grievances in white, blue,
and yellow. At the beginning of the game, the value of these is all
zero.</p>
<p>Certain actions taken against a bot, by a player or other bot, will
result in a grievance. The target of the action will gain one or more
grievance matching the source. Each of the following results in the
target gaining one grievance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battle action with bot as the defender</li>
<li>destroy one or more bot pieces (limit 1 per action)</li>
<li>steal a resource or guild card from the bot (limit 1 per
action)</li>
<li>target bot city with a Tax action</li>
<li>take one or more bot agents captive (limit 1 per action)</li>
</ul>
<div class="pagebreak">

</div>
<h2 id="negotiation-minigame-optional">Negotiation Minigame
(Optional)</h2>
<p>During the Negotiations phase of a Summit, the player has an
opportunity to offer bots negotiation actions, and each bot may do the
same with other bots. This takes the form of a new, solo-specific
minigame. This alternative enables a solo player to engage with all of
the mechanics of the campaign, and makes it possible for certain Fates
which rely on the Negotiation mechanics (Magnate, Caretaker) to be
piloted by a player or a bot.</p>
<p>When a Summit occurs, after the “Call to Order” phase, follow this
sequence of play for the minigame:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the number of rounds: roll 1d6 and add 1 per bot</li>
<li>Player(s) may settle Grievances with favors:
<ul>
<li>if a player returns a favor to a bot <em>(without forcing any
negotiation actions)</em> or gives one of their agents to a bot as a
favor, reduce the bot’s Grievances matching the player by one</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Starting with the bot or player with initiative, conduct negotiation
rounds</li>
<li>On a player’s round, they may attempt a trade with a bot.
<ul>
<li>If the trade is successful, they must pass to next player or bot in
turn order</li>
<li>After 3 consecutive failures, they must pass to next player or bot
in turn order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>During a bot’s negotiation round, it will attempt one negotiation
with another bot, then pass</li>
<li>After each player and bot as had a turn, end minigame <em>(even if
rounds remain)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Each negotiation round is a single trade attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player or bot will offer to exchange one or more negotiation actions
with a target bot</li>
<li>Player or bot will commit to an offer, then roll 1d6 to determine if
the target bot accepts</li>
<li>The target bot will accept on a modified roll of a 5 or 6</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply the following DRMs to the roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>
-1 for each successive failed attempt
</li>
<li>
-1 for each matching Grievance
</li>
<li>
-1 if trade would cause rival of target to <ins>contend</ins> a declared
ambition
</li>
<li>
-X if bot is <ins>contending</ins> a declared ambition. X=power bot
would gain from the ambition
</li>
<li>
+1 for each negotiation action offered above an even trade
</li>
<li>
+1 if trade would cause target to <ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition
</li>
<li>
+1 if trade would cause bot to directly or indirectly advance objective
</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine bot-bot offers, examine each rival bot in turn order,
and identify what the active bot “wants” from the other bot. Use these
priorities, and if none apply, pass next player or bot, but still count
the round as having occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>resource, trophy, or captive which would cause bot to
<ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition</li>
<li>negotiation actions which would directly or indirectly advance bot’s
objective</li>
</ul>
The active bot will offer the target resources and favors such that the
final DRM is +2. Bot will not offer resources matching declared ambition
bot is currently <ins>contending</ins>.

Cube Bag</h2>
<p>This minigame has less setup than the Letter Tiles minigame, however
it has a much more involved system and may be harder to learn and
play.</p>
<p>Unlike the multiplayer game and the Letter Tiles minigame, the Portal
is not in a single fixed location at the start of Act II. Instead, its
location is uncertain until narrowed down to a single planet. A
probabilistic method is used to hide the Portal’s location from both the
player and the bot. The Pathfinder (either bot or player) will need to
narrow down the possible locations using an identical logical deduction
process as they would in the original multiplayer game.</p>
<p>Each time “Uncovering Clues” is used, one “round” of the minigame
will result in either a Clue token or the Portal token being placed on
the map. The minigame builds a pool of cubes which are used to randomly
determine which token to place. The distribution of cubes ensures that
Clue tokens are never placed which contradict previous Clues.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Each space on the chart represents one of the 18 planets on the
board, identified by the symbol (column) and cluster number (row).
During the minigame pieces (meeples, cubes, and the pawn) will be added
and removed from the chart and used to randomly select a Clue token.</p>
<p>The pawn is placed on the space corresponding to the target planet,
i.e. the current “guess”. <em>(the planet where the Pathfinder’s
Flagship is located)</em> The pawn is placed at the start of the
minigame and removed at the end.</p>
<p>Red and blue meeples are added to the chart and correspond to Clue
tokens placed on the map. Meeples are never removed from the chart.</p>
<ul>
<li>a blue meeple matches a “check” token</li>
<li>a red meeple matches an “x” token</li>
</ul>
<p>Cubes are added to the chart during an individual round of the
minigame and are removed and used in the randomization step at the end
of each round. Each cube contributes to the probability that the Portal
is or is not one of the planets in relation to the target planet. A red
cube increases the chance that the portal is not at a related planet. A
blue cube increases the chance that the Portal is at a related planet. A
yellow cube contributes to the probability that the Portal is at the
target planet.</p>

<h3 id="adding-and-removing-cubes">Adding and removing cubes</h3>
<p>Important rules and reminders to follow when adding and removing
cubes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always add cubes first, exactly in the order described</li>
<li>After adding cubes, only then remove any cubes as instructed</li>
<li>A space is “empty” if it has nothing in it (no cube, no meeple, and
no pawn)</li>
<li>A piece “intersects” with another piece or space if they shares a
column or row.</li>
<li>A space will never have more than one cube</li>
<li>A cube will never be placed in a space with a meeple</li>
<li>A cube may be placed in a space with the pawn</li>
</ul>
<p>When adding cubes to the chart, first count the number of blue
meeples. Add cubes according to the section matching how many blue
meeples are already present on the chart.</p>
<p><strong>Zero blue meeples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Space with pawn: add a yellow cube</li>
<li>Empty spaces intersecting pawn: add blue cube</li>
<li>Every other empty space: add red cube</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One or more blue meeples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every space which intersects with ALL blue meeples AND intersects
with the pawn:
<ul>
<li>if pawn is in the space add a yellow cube</li>
<li>if space is empty add a blue cube</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every space which intersects with ALL blue meeples:
<ul>
<li>if the space is empty add a red cube</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Removing cubes</strong></p>
<p>After adding cubes above, if there are any red meeples then some
cubes may be removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove cubes from every space intersecting with a red meeple.

<p>This minigame has a more involved setup than the Cube Bag minigame
and requires tiles to be placed in every planet on the board, however it
is easier to play once the setup is complete.</p>
<h3 id="components-2">Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>36 wooden letter tiles:
<ul>
<li>9 vowels (or all the same letter)</li>
<li>27 consonants (or all the same letter, but a different letter from
first set of 9)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The letters do not matter, what matters is that you have 36 pieces
which can be turned face down to hide their value, and that you have 9
of one value and 27 of another value.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these rules and examples, it will be assumed that
you have 9 vowels and 27 consonants. The vowels represent a successful
clue and the consonants represent an unsuccessful clue.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Organize 18 of the tiles into 3 facedown groups of 6 each:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>one group of 6 vowels</li>
<li>two groups of 6 consonants each</li>
</ul>
<p>Set aside the other 18 tiles for now.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Keeping the groups distinct, randomize them such that the player
does not know which group is which. This requires a little care to avoid
turning tiles over or accidentally co-mingling the groups. After this
step, you should have 3 facedown groups, each with 6 tiles, and each
group should still consist of all the same kind of tile, but the player
should not know what kind of tiles are contained in each group.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting with one of the groups and keeping the tiles facedown,
place one tile from this group in each of the planets with a hex symbol.
Repeat this with another group and the arrow planets, and finally with
the last group and the moon planets. After this step, each planet will
have a single facedown tile, and all the planets with the same symbol
will have tiles which originated from the same group.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="pagebreak">

</div>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Organize the remaining tiles into 6 facedown groups of 3 each:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>one group of 3 vowels</li>
<li>five groups of 3 consonants each</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Just as in step 4, randomize these groups such that the player
does not know which group is which but the groups remain
distinct.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, like in step 3, take one of the groups and place them on
the map, keeping them facedown. Place one tile from this group in each
planet of a cluster. Repeat this step for each cluster, so that each
cluster gets tiles its own group.</p></li>
<li><p>Each planet should now have 2 facedown tiles, one from step 3 and
one from step 6. Optionally mix the two tiles at each planet so that the
player does not know which tile came from which step (at this step no
tile is changing the planet it is assigned to. the 2 tiles on each
planet should just be indistinguishable from each other)</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="uncovering-clues">Uncovering Clues</h3>
<p>After the above setup is complete, one of the 18 planets has 2 vowel
tiles, the other planets in the same cluster have 1 vowel, and the other
planets with the matching symbol have 1 vowel. All other planets have 2
consonant tiles. The Portal is located on the planet with with 2
vowels.</p>
<p>Each time the Prelude ability on “Uncovering Clues” is used, turn
over both tiles at the target planet. If both of the tiles are vowels,
place the Portal token; it has been found. If only one of the tiles is a
vowel, place a Clue token with the “check” side face up. If both tiles
are consonants, place a Clue token with the “x” side face up. These Clue
tokens retain their original meaning as described on the cards
“Uncovering Clues” and “Clues to the Portal” (F9-03).</p>

<h1 id="combat-principles">Combat Principles</h1>
<p>When asked if bot can <ins>favorable combat</ins> to achieve some
result, first identify the goal, then refer to the corresponding section
below. Goal will always be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trophies for warlord</li>
<li>Raid for resource(s) or card(s) to <ins>contend</ins> an
ambition</li>
<li>Control of a system</li>
</ul>
<p>Bot will spend Weapon resources to enable combat and will spend Fuel
and Psionic resources to maximize available actions during a combat.</p>
<p>A combat which risks outrages is only favorable if bot could ransack
the court AND if outrage would not cause bot to stop
<ins>contending</ins> a declared ambition. Ransack for most trophies. If
bot is able to re-roll, first re-roll any intercepts, then re-roll
blanks.</p>
<h2 id="trophies">Trophies</h2>
<p>A Battle for trophies is considered favorable if bot has at least 1:1
ratio of fresh ships or can roll 2 dice vs Blight.</p>
<p>If bot has multiple actions, first roll all skirmish dice until ratio
of fresh ships is better than 1:1, or only 1 action left. Then roll
assault dice up to 2x defending fresh ships, and the rest skirmish dice.
Prefer target where most possible trophies. Allocate hits prioritizing
trophies.</p>
<h2 id="raid">Raid</h2>
<p>A raid is considered favorable if bot can roll raid dice equal to 2x
keys on the target AND bot has better than 1:1 ratio of fresh ships to
defender OR has 1:1 ratio AND more than one Battle action available
after moving to the target.</p>
<p>If favorable, the bot will first spend actions to roll dice like a
trophies Battle, up to the last action available, when it will roll raid
dice. Allocate hits like control.</p>
<h2 id="control">Control</h2>
<p>A Battle for control is favorable is bot can roll at least 1 die per
fresh defending ship. If favorable, bot will select dice like a trophies
Battle. Bot will allocate hits to take or neutralize control, then
allocate hits to take trophies.</p>

<h1 id="expansion-principles">Expansion Principles</h1>
<p>When getting new <ins>claims</ins> and building new cities the bot
will follow these guidelines. Note that the bot will still use the
guidance in the “Movement Principles” to move ships. This page aims to
clarify <strong>when</strong> the bot will expand by getting new
<ins>claims</ins> and building new cities, not explain
<strong>how</strong> the bot will move. Use “Movement Principles” to
determine how the moves are carried out.</p>
<h2 id="getting-new-claims">Getting New <ins>Claims</ins></h2>
<p>A <ins>claim</ins> is an open building slot on a planet where the bot
has one or more pieces, i.e. it is a building slot where the bot could
legally build a city or starport. Count each slot separately: if the bot
has a ship at a planet with two open slots, count the bot as having two
<ins>claims</ins>.</p>
<p><em>(Note that in previous versions of SUPERCAT, a <ins>claim</ins>
was an open building slot <strong>controlled</strong> by the bot. This
has since been relaxed to deprioritize expansion. If a bot has a ship or
other building enabling it to build in an open slot, that counts as a
<ins>claim</ins>, regardless of control of the system)</em></p>
<p>The procedures evaluate the number of <ins>claims</ins> the bot has
in relation to the number of <ins>unbuilt cities</ins> (cities on the
bot’s board which it could build, not any cities held by rivals as
trophies). The bot will seek to gain new <ins>claims</ins> if it has
fewer <ins>claims</ins> than half the number of <ins>unbuilt
cities</ins>, rounded down.</p>
<p><em>(Note that this differs between the campaign game and the base
game: in the campaign game the bot is satisfied with fewer
<ins>claims</ins> than in the base game)</em></p>
<h2 id="limit-on-building-new-cities">Limit on Building New Cities</h2>
<p>The procedures prioritize building new cities somewhat highly
relative to other actions. However there is a limit to this which is
building a second city on the same planet where the bot already has a
city. The bot will only build one of these <ins>double cities</ins> if
it is winning a declared ambition (not tied for first place) and placing
the city would uncover a power bonus.</p>
<p><em>Note that a <ins>claim</ins> counts for the purpose of the
expansion priorities described above even if the bot would not build a
city there due to this limit. For instance, if a bot has 4 <ins>unbuilt
cities</ins>, and has a ship at a planet with 2 slots, it is considered
to have 2 <ins>claims</ins> even though when it comes time to build a
city, the bot would only build 1 city there.</em></p>

<h1 id="movement-principles">Movement Principles</h1>
<p>When moving ships, the bot will follow these guidelines. Note that
this page covers movement generally; for specific guidance on bot
behavior around when the bot will seek to get new <ins>claims</ins> and
build cities, see the “Expansion Principles”. That page explains
<strong>when</strong> the bot will expand while this one describes
<strong>how</strong> movement is carried out.</p>
<p>Each movement has an origin, a destination, and a goal. The
procedures will define a specific goal, for example changing control of
a system with loyal buildings. The goal will define one or more
destinations. The specific destination and origin should be selected
according to the priorities below.</p>
<p>In rare cases, the bot will not reach its destination on a single
card. These are called partial moves and the bot will only make moves
like this if explicitly instructed to. In these circumstances, evaluate
destinations and goals independently each time the bot plays a card, as
the priorities may change on a future movement.</p>
<h2 id="priorities-1">Priorities:</h2>
<p>Select origin and destination which takes the shortest path
(i.e. spend fewest action). Move as many ships from the origin while
following the priorities below, including damaged ships.</p>
<p>When possible, retain control of the origin system. If it’s not
possible to reach the destination and achieve the goal while retaining
control of the origin, check for other origins. If it’s not possible to
retain control of any origin, abandon control of origin.</p>
<p>If multiple origins and destinations meet above criteria, use these
priorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>if goal is not new <ins>claims</ins>, prefer destinations which
result in new <ins>claims</ins></li>
<li>if goal is not control, prefer destinations which result in bot
control of rival or Free city.</li>
<li>if otherwise equal options, select <ins>task force</ins> as the
origin system</li>
</ul>
<p>When destination contains Blight and Imperial ships not present at
destination, bring Imperial ships if possible. Otherwise, leave Imperial
ships to retain Empire control if including them in the move would give
rival control of loyal building.</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>
<p>Every question should have a yes or no answer. There are four types
of questions. Use the following guide if you are confused how to follow
the procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Type 1</strong>: This type of question will be a single line
like this:</p>
<p><em>Can bot take some action to achieve some goal?</em></p>
<p>If the bot is able to take the action, following all the rules of the
game, to achieve the stated goal, then take the action. If the answer is
“no”, continue reading to the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Type 2</strong>: This type of question will have one nested
subsection that is not marked.</p>
<p><em>Question about the game state?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Action to take, or other question to evaluate, if answer to
first question was “yes”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is “yes”, follow the nested procedures. If the answer
is “no”, then continue reading to the next section.</p>
<p><strong>Type 3</strong>: This type of question will have two nested
subsections, one marked “yes” and the other marked “no”.</p>
<p><em>Question about the game state?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Action to take, or other question to evaluate, if answer to
first question was “yes”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>No:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Action to take, or other question to evaluate, if answer to
first question was “no”</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is “yes”, continue with subsection marked “yes”,
otherwise continue with the subsection marked “no”.</p>
<p><strong>Type 4</strong>: This type of question is only used on the
General Priorities page.</p>
<p><em>Can bot take some action? → Card suit</em></p>
<p>In this case, if the answer is “yes” AND the bot has a card of the
indicated suit available (either one of 2 cards draw, or the lead card
to copy), then select that card. Proceed to the page for the selected
suit.</p>
<div class="pagebreak">

</div>
<h1 id="clarifications">Clarifications</h1>
<p>The concept of <ins>contending</ins> ambitions is important. This is
a special keyword: to <ins>contend</ins> an ambition means take any
action which improves the bot’s position for that ambition such that the
bot takes first or second place, including ties.</p>
<p>There is a difference between <ins>contending</ins> an ambition and
“winning or tied for first place”, which is that <ins>contending</ins>
also includes second place and ties for second place. The bot will only
declare an <ins>undeclared ambition</ins> if it is winning or tied for
first place; it will not declare an ambition if it is in second
place.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bot will only declare an ambition which has already
been declared (double or triple declare to add second or third marker to
the ambition box) if it is <strong>winning</strong> the ambition. It
will not double or triple declare if it is tied for first place.</p>
