# Leaders and Lore

The bot performs better in "vanilla" games. To keep the procedures streamlined there is only limited support for Leaders and Lore. Here are several options for different styles of solo gaming.

**If you don't mind making decisions for the non-player system:**

Draft L&L as normal, choosing the most interesting options for yourself and for each bot. When an opportunity arises, override the procedures to take advantage of L&L abilities. This option is good for experimenting with new combinations but requires some mental flexibility and is a less robust solo challenge.

**If you prefer the non-player system makes all decisions:**

First, randomly assign a Leader to each bot from this list:

- Rebel
- Quartermaster
- Corsair

Then randomly assign a Lore to each bot from this list:

- Seeker Torpedoes
- Railgun Arrays
- Repair Drones
- Signal Breaker
- Mirror Plating

Finally, draw two Leaders and two Lore, and choose one of each for the player.
