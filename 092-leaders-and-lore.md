# Leaders and Lore

The bot performs better in "vanilla" games. To keep the procedures streamlined there is only limited support for Leaders and Lore. Here are several options for different styles of solo gaming.

**If you don't mind intervening on behalf of the non-player system:**

Draft L&L as normal, choosing the most interesting options for yourself and for each bot. When an opportunity arises, override the procedures to take advantage of L&L abilities. This option is good for experimenting with new combinations but requires some mental flexibility and is a less robust solo challenge.

**If you prefer the non-player system makes as many decisions as possible:**

Some of the Leaders and Lore abilities are "passive" in that they confer benefits which do not require much in the way of extra decision making. The bot will still make sub-optimal use of them since there are no special cases in the procedures to capitalize on the advantages.

First, randomly assign a Leader to each bot from this list:

- Rebel
- Quartermaster
- Corsair

Then randomly assign a Lore to each bot from this list:

- Seeker Torpedoes
- Railgun Arrays
- Repair Drones
- Signal Breaker
- Mirror Plating

Finally, draw two Leaders and two Lore, and choose one of each for the player.
