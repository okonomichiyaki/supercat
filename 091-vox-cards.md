# Vox Cards

The bot will secure a Vox card if it is <ins>effective</ins> or if Securing the card will take captives. In general, a Vox card is <ins>effective</ins> if its **When Secured** text can be fully carried out. The following guidelines explain when a Vox card is <ins>effective</ins> and gives instructions for how to perform the text for the bot.

Mass Uprising
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot has 4 or more ships in its supply. Choose the cluster with the <ins>task force</ins>. If no <ins>task force</ins>, then choose randomly.

Populist Demands
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot is winning or tied for first in an <ins>undeclared</ins> ambition. Choose an ambition the bot is winning, if possible. If only Securing for captives, do not choose an ambition.

Outrage Spreads
: <ins>Effective</ins> if outrage would cause a player to stop winning a declared ambition. If multiple options, choose whichever resource bot has fewest of. If unable to stop a player from winning an ambition, do not trigger outrage.

Song of Freedom
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot controls a rival city and it's possible to seize the initiative. If not possible to seize the initiative, secure only for captives.

Guild Struggle
: <ins>Effective</ins> if rivals have any guild cards. Steal a guild card to <ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition or <ins>contend</ins> an undeclared ambition. Otherwise use "Influence Doctrine".

Call to Action
: Always <ins>effective</ins>

Council Intrigue <!-- TODO: when is this effective?-->
: Move agents to other cards in the court according to "Influence Doctrine".

Diplomatic Fiasco
: <ins>Effective</ins> if at least one rival would be impacted by the Crisis. During the Crisis, select Guild cards for bot to discard which do not match declared ambitions.

Blight Looms
: <ins>Effective</ins> if there is any damaged Blight in a cluster with loyal pieces, and if trophies gained would contend for warlord (whether or not it is declared). During resolution, if more than one cluster, choose the cluster with more damaged Blight.
