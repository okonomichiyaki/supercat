# Partisan (Act 1)

✦ Can bot Influence or Secure a card which would enable it to gain the initiative?

✦ Can bot Influence or Secure a card which would give the bot an additional action card?

✦ Does bot have 4 or more cards and can bot use Informants' **Spy (Influence)** ability?
<br/>*(limit once per chapter)*

Informants
: To use this ability when the player is the Partisan, choose a bot to target. Draw a number of action cards equal to the bot's hand counter. Place your action card with the highest number on the bot board and take the card with the highest number from those drawn. Shuffle the rest back into the stack. If bot uses the ability, do the same but always target the player.

Partisan Seizing
: If the bot is the Partisan, use a seize counter and check for seizing the initiative as described on the "Bot Turn" page. Add 1 to the roll for each outraged resource type. If the seize check passes (roll is less than seize counter) instead of decrementing the hand counter, outrage a resource. Select resource based on least impact.
