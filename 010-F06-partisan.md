# Partisan

## Act I

✦ Can bot Secure or Influence a card which would enable it to gain the initiative?

✦ Can bot Secure or Influence a card which would give the bot an additional action card?

✦ Does bot have 4 or more cards and can bot use Informants' **Spy (Influence)** ability?
<br/>*(limit once per chapter, see special rules below)*

Partisan Seizing (Ability)
: If the bot is the Partisan, use a seize counter and check for seizing the initiative as described on the "Bot Turn" page. Add 1 to the roll for each Outraged resource. If the seize check passes (modified roll is less than seize counter) instead of decrementing the hand counter, Provoke Outrage for a resource, if there is a non-Outraged resource not matching a Protected Guild card. Select resource to Outrage based on least impact (fewest cards and resources discarded).

## Act II

✦ Can bot Secure or Influence any Guild card matching an Outraged resource?

✦ Does a Rival have the initiative?

- Does bot have 4 or more cards and can bot use Informants' **Spy (Influence)** ability?
<br/>*(limit once per chapter, see special rules below)*

People's Hero
: Bot will clear an Outrage using this ability any time it is able to. In addition, bot will now declare ambitions with a matching card when it is in second place for the ambition, including ties (as well as when winning or tied for first place). Bot will still only double declare ambitions if it is winning.

Partisan Seizing (Law)
: After this Law is added to the rules booklet, all bots will use the above guidelines from Act I above to dictate seizing behavior.

<!--
TODO: this needs to be tweaked for other bots
maybe +1 for each Guild/Resource bot has?
select the resource first based on least impact, and +1 for each matching selected?
maybe also special case for certain Fates like Advocate
