# Prelude

After a card has been selected, before following procedures for the card's suit, check to see if bot will spend resources and/or guild cards for Prelude actions. Bot will use resources and guild cards according to the following guidelines.

## Restrictions

Bot will not spend resources or guild cards matching a declared ambition, with one exception. Specifically:

- if Tycoon is declared do not spend Fuel or Material resources or guild cards
- if Empath is declared do not spend Psionic resource or guild cards
- if Seeker is declared do not spend Relic resources or guild cards, UNLESS securing a Relic card

## Resources

**Material**: spend to Build a starport if none on map, otherwise Build cities, then ships

**Fuel and Weapon**: spend for Combat card

**Relic**: Secure for captives, contend a declared ambition, or effective Vox card.

**Psionic**: Tax/Secure to contend a declared ambition, or spend for Combat card

See "Combat principles" for more details on Fuel, Weapon, and Psionic usage.

## Guild cards

Bot will discard some guild card for their prelude effect at the first opportunity.

Bot will discard a Weapon guild card for effect, if it has 3 ships available. Place ships at starport with most fresh ships, otherwise with task force.

Bot will discard a Union card for effect. Place action card in bot's play area, and increment bot's hand counter.
