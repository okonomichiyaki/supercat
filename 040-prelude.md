# Prelude

After a card has been selected, before following procedures for the card's suit, check to see if bot will spend resources and/or Guild cards for Prelude actions. Bot will use resources and Guild cards according to the following guidelines.

## Restrictions

Bot will not spend resources or Guild cards matching a declared ambition, with one exception. Specifically:

- if Tycoon is declared do not spend Fuel or Material resources or Guild cards
- if Empath is declared do not spend Psionic resource or Guild cards
- if Keeper is declared do not spend Relic resources or Guild cards, UNLESS securing a Relic card

## Resources

**Material**: spend to Build a starport if none on map, otherwise Build cities, then ships

**Fuel**: spend for Expansion Principles or Combat card

**Weapon**: spend for Combat card

**Relic**: Secure for captives, contend a declared ambition, or effective Vox card

**Psionic**: Tax/Secure to contend a declared ambition, or spend for Combat card

See "Combat principles" for more details on Fuel, Weapon, and Psionic usage.

## Guild cards

Bot will discard some Guild card for their Prelude ability at the first opportunity.

Bot will discard a Weapon Guild card for Prelude ability if it has 3 ships available. Place ships at starport with most fresh ships, otherwise with task force.

Bot will discard all Union cards to gain bonus action cards. Place action card in bot's play area, and increment bot's hand counter.
