# Believer

<dt>Setup</dt>
<dd>
Place 2 cities instead of a city and a starport. Prefer:
<ul>
<li>planets matching suits on guild cards in the initial court</li>
<li>planets with 2 different suits</li>
</ul>
</dd>

## Act I

✦ Can bot use Spreading the Faith's **Teach (Influence)** ability? *(attach a Faithful card to a Guild card in the Court matching a Loyal city)*

- Prefer:
	- Guild card with Loyal agents

✦ Are there remaining cards in the stack of Faithful action cards?

- Are there any suits which bot does not have a matching Loyal city?
	- Can bot get a claim on a planet with that suit?

## Act II

✦ Can bot Tax, Secure, or favorable battle to improve its position in an ambition with an Ideal marker? *(any improvement in the bot's ranking for the ambition, not just first or second place)*

<!--
If the bot does not have initiative, after drawing 2 action cards ("Bot Turn") and decrementing the hand counter, check the following:

- Is one of those cards a Faithful card?
- Does bot's hand counter show 2 or greater?
- Are there undeclared ambitions?

If all are true, bot will take the Faithful card. Place it in the bot's play area. Select the other card to play. When checking for bot seizing the initiative, subtract 1 from the die roll for each Faithful card in the bot's play area.

If the bot has initiative, and has a Faithful card in its play area, check the following:

- is bot winning or tied for first place for an undeclared ambition?

If true, do not draw 2 cards, simply play the Faithful card and declare the ambition.
-->

The Young Light
: Bot will use this Prelude ability whenever possible. *(discard an action card to take a played Faithful card. decrement the bot's hand counter to represent discarding an action card)*

Set Doctrine
: If bot can Secure to contend an ambition, switch to Wisdom. If bot can Tax or favorable combat to contend an ambition, switch to Zeal. Otherwise do not switch.
