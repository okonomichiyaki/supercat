# Believer

<dt>Setup</dt>
<dd>
Place 2 cities instead of a city and a starport. Prefer:
<ul>
<li>planets matching suits on guild cards in the initial court</li>
<li>planets with a single building slot</li>
<li>planets with different suits</li>
</ul>
</dd>

## Faithful Cards

Since Faithful cards enable any type of action, they are not selected normally via "General Priorities". If any bot needs to use "General Priorities" to select between a Faithful card and any other card, read down the procedures as normal until identifying the bot's priority. If the bot can take the prioritized action using the Faithful card, select that card and turn to the page for the Faithful suit.

## Act I

✦ Can bot use Spreading the Faith's **Teach (Influence)** ability?

- Spend as many additional actions as possible
- Prefer:
	- Guild card with Loyal agents

✦ Are there remaining cards in the stack of Faithful action cards?

- Does bot have unbuilt cities, and are there any suits which bot does not have a matching Loyal city?
	- Can bot Build a city or get a claim on a planet matching one of those suits?

## Act II

✦ Does a Rival have "The Young Light" ?

- Can bot favorable combat to steal "The Young Light" ?

✦ Can bot Tax, Secure, or favorable battle to improve its position in an ambition with an Ideal marker? *(any improvement in the bot's ranking for the ambition, not just first or second place)*

<!--
If the bot does not have initiative, after drawing 2 action cards ("Bot Turn") and decrementing the hand counter, check the following:

- Is one of those cards a Faithful card?
- Does bot's hand counter show 2 or greater?
- Are there undeclared ambitions?

If all are true, bot will take the Faithful card. Place it in the bot's play area. Select the other card to play. When checking for bot seizing the initiative, subtract 1 from the die roll for each Faithful card in the bot's play area.

If the bot has initiative, and has a Faithful card in its play area, check the following:

- is bot winning or tied for first place for an undeclared ambition?

If true, do not draw 2 cards, simply play the Faithful card and declare the ambition.
-->

The Young Light
: Bot will use this Prelude ability whenever possible. *(bot's hand counter must be 1 or greater. at the end of the round, place the Faithful card in the bot's play area. do not change the bot's hand counter)*

Set Doctrine
: If bot can Secure to contend an ambition, switch to Wisdom. If bot can Tax or favorable combat to contend an ambition, switch to Zeal. Otherwise do not switch.

# Act III

When bot has the initiative and there are undeclared ambitions, if a Faithful card is available (either among those drawn or in the bot's play area), then bot will always lead with a Faithful card and declare an undeclared ambition. Prefer:

- ambition bot is winning or tied for first place
- ambition for which bot is currently in third place
- ambition for which no rival is winning or tied for first place

The Prophet
: Bot will use this Prelude ability whenever possible. *(bot's hand counter must be 1 or greater. at the end of the round, place the Faithful card in the bot's play area. do not change the bot's hand counter)*
