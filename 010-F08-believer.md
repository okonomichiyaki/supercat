# Believer

<dt>Setup</dt>
<dd>
Place 2 cities instead of a city and a starport. Prefer:
<ul>
<li>planets matching suits on guild cards in the initial court</li>
<li>planets with 2 different suits</li>
</ul>
</dd>

## Act I

✦ Can bot use Spreading the Faith's **Teach (Influence)** ability? *(attach a Faithful card to a Guild card in the Court matching a Loyal city)*

- Prefer:
	- Guild card with Loyal agents

✦ Are there remaining cards in the stack of Faithful action cards?

- Are there any suits which bot does not have a matching Loyal city?
	- Can bot get a claim on a planet with that suit?

## Act II

If the bot does not have initiative, after drawing 2 action cards ("Bot Turn"), check the following:

- is one of those cards a Faithful card?
- does bot's hand counter show 2 or greater?

If both are true, bot will take the Faithful card:
Place it in the bot's play area and decrement the hand counter.
Select the other card to play.

When checking for bot seizing the initiative, subtract 1 from the die roll for each Faithful card in the bot's play area.

If the bot has initiative, and has a Faithful card in its play area, check the following:

- is bot winning or tied for first place for an undeclared ambition?

If true, do not draw 2 cards, simply play the Faithful card and declare the ambition.

The Young Light
: Bot will always use this Prelude ability when possible. *(decrement hand counter to represent discarding an action card)*

Set Doctrine
: If bot can Secure to contend an ambition, switch to Wisdom. If bot can Tax or favorable combat to contend an ambition, switch to Zeal. Otherwise do not switch.
