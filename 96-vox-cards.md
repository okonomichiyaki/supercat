# Vox Cards

The bot will secure a Vox card if it is <ins>effective</ins>, or if securing the card will take captives. A Vox card is <ins>effective</ins> if its event can be fully carried out. The following guidelines explain when a Vox card is effective and gives instructions for how to perform the event for the bot.

Mass Uprising
: Effective if the bot has 4 or more ships in its supply. Choose the cluster with the <ins>task force</ins>. If no <ins>task force</ins>, then choose randomly.

Populist Demands
: Effective if there are <ins>undeclared</ins> ambitions and if the bot is winning or tied for first in an ambition. Choose an ambition the bot is winning outright, if possible. If securing for captives, do not choose an ambition.

Outrage Spreads
: Never effective. Secure only for captives, and then outrage whichever resource the bot has none of, but other players have some. Otherwise, do not provoke outrage.

Song of Freedom
: Effective if the bot controls a rival city and it's possible to seize the initiative. If not possible to seize the initiative, secure only for captives.

Guild Struggle
: Effective if rivals have any guild cards. Steal a guild card to <ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition or <ins>contend</ins> an undeclared ambition. Otherwise choose randomly.

Call to Action
: Always effective
