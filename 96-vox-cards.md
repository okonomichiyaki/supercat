The bot will secure a Vox card if it is <ins>effective</ins> or if Securing the card will take captives. A Vox card is <ins>effective</ins> if its event can be fully carried out. The following guidelines explain when a Vox card is <ins>effective</ins> and gives instructions for how to perform the event for the bot.

Mass Uprising
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot has 4 or more ships in its supply. Choose the cluster with the <ins>task force</ins>. If no <ins>task force</ins>, then choose randomly.

Populist Demands
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot is winning or tied for first in an <ins>undeclared</ins> ambition. Choose an ambition the bot is winning, if possible. If only Securing for captives, do not choose an ambition.

Outrage Spreads
: <ins>Effective</ins> if outrage would cause a human player to stop winning a declared ambition. If multiple options, choose whichever resource bot has fewest of. If unable to stop a human player from winning an ambition, do not trigger outrage.

Song of Freedom
: <ins>Effective</ins> if the bot controls a rival city and it's possible to seize the initiative. If not possible to seize the initiative, secure only for captives.

Guild Struggle
: <ins>Effective</ins> if rivals have any guild cards. Steal a guild card to <ins>contend</ins> a declared ambition or <ins>contend</ins> an undeclared ambition. Otherwise use "Influence Doctrine" priorities to select a card.
