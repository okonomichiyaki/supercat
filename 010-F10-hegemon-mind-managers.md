# Mind Managers - Manipulate (Influence)

If the player is the Hegemon:

- Choose a Rival bot that you have a Captive of.
- Draw action cards from the stack and place them in the bot's play area until the bot has as cards in its play area equal to its hand counter.
- Take one card from the bot's play area and add it to your hand.
- Give the bot any card from your hand by adding it to the bot's play area.

If the bot is the Hegemon:

- Target the player if possible (if the bot has a Captive of the player's, and the player has cards in their hand). Otherwise do not use the ability.
- Select a card from the player's hand at random and place it in the bot's play area.
- Draw one card from the top of the stack and add it to the player's hand.
