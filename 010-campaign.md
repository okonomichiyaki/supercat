## Event Cards

After an Event card is played, do not add it to the discard pile. Instead, set played Event cards aside and only shuffle them with the action cards prior to dealing at the start of the next chapter.

*(Since the bot may reshuffle the action card deck this is to ensure Event cards do not occur more frequently than in multiplayer games)*




## Negotiations

During a Summit, the player will have an opportunity offer the bots negotiation actions, and each bot may do the same with other bots. This takes the form of a minigame. Of course this cannot approximate the scope of human interaction which occurs in a multiplayer game, but it is an alternative enabling a solo player to see all of the mechanics of the campaign. This also makes it possible for the Magnate to be played by a player or bot.

## Negotiation Mini Game

- determine the number of rounds (1d6 +1 per bot)
- player(s) may settle grievances with favors:
	- if a player returns a favor to a bot, or gives one of their agents as a favor, reduce the bot's grievances matching the player by one
- starting with the bot or player with the initiative, conduct negotiation rounds
- on a player's round, that player may attempt a trade with a bot
	- if successful, must pass to next player or bot in turn order
	- if 3 consecutive failures, must pass to next player or bot in turn order
- during a bot's negotiation round, it will attempt one negotiation with another bot, then pass
- if multiple players, after all negotiation rounds have been completed, players may freely negotiate as per the rules

each negotiation round is a single trade attempt:

- player or bot will offer to exchange one or more negotiation actions with a target bot
- player or bot will commit to an offer, then roll 1d6 to determine if the target bot accepts
- the target bot will accept on a modified roll of a 5 or 6
note: bots do not offer trades to the player, only to other bots.

apply the following DRMs to this roll:

<ul>
<li>-1 for each successive failed attempt</li>
<li>-1 for each grievance</li>
<li>-1 if trade would cause target to contend a declared ambition</li>
<li>-X if bot is contending a declared ambition. X=power bot would gain from the ambition if it was scored right now</li>
<li>+1 for each negotiation action offered above an even trade</li>
<li>+1 if trade would cause bot to contend a declared ambition</li>
<li>+1 if trade would cause bot to advance objective</li>
</ul>
